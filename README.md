# SSN1600CSE5335-Project2

---------------------------------------------------Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Server side Framework: Rails was used for this project.

Data was loaded on Mongolabs.

Client side  Framework: Javascript and Jquery

(A) What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

I have implemented scripts for inserting and retrieving data into Mongolabs using ruby which was quite easy. I got the steps of how to make connection with heroku and make  these scripts and load it on mongolabs which makes this task quite easy.

(B) What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

I was using ruby for developing scripts for this projects. Developing Main controller class to get the results so that I can bind it with my jquery was the diffcult task. the reason was it was first time I did something using ruby and ruby is the language where we 
have to make changes with config files also which had made this project challenging.
I had faced diffculty while running the code on local machine. Sometimes it happen that data would not get load properly and all the data would not be loaded. Sometimes it also happen that though the server was running but browser will show "The page cannot be dispalyed" message.

(C) If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern.

Currently ruby on rails, jquery and as client and server side framework which are the latest trends in field of Information Technology.
I would definitely agree to ues this technologies professionally because creating a scable web application using these technolgies is quite
logical and  significant. Though we follow MVC architecture for each technology but, in this case following MVC architecture perfectly and debugging such
applications on various cloud would be challenging task.
